	YXA source code documentation


@title Local additions

@doc This is a place where you can put modules you want compiled when
     you compile YXA, but that are not part of the official distribution.

     The idea is that you should have to spend as little time as possible
     merging local changes when upgrading YXA, so this directory provides
     you with a Makefile.in that will change very infrequently.
